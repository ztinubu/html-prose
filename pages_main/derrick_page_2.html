			DA: To make art, you don’t really need to have motivation. Most people who are creative just create for <a href="conclusion.html">a need to communicate.</a> Even in Baltimore, where I grew up, art was something I would see, like murals in the street, but with education, you learn the business of art. I think black culture has always been a creative culture, and we’ve done things like making art out of textiles without thinking about the commercial world. We’ve been doing what we’re doing, and now people are looking. They have the privilege—people are looking. They are being elevated.
