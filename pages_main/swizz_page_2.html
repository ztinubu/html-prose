			SB: When people started getting into hip-hop, it’s like where we are now in art. People figured out how to build a market around it, how to cannibalize it, how to make it a currency. It’s up to us to protect our own currency, which is our creativity.

			That’s why we collect the way we do for the <a href="black_art.html">Dean Collection: We have to own our story.</a> Many people approach me, asking how they can make money as a collector, and I’ve never made money as a collector. When we get works in the collection, I look at it as an introduction into the family and not a transaction. 

			If you have someone like myself, a known collector, showing people how to flip works in the art market, that’s a double negative. But if a collector teaches a new collector to work on a personal level with the artists, support living artists, and maintain and hold on to art, it’ll help build a sustainable message in this rising market of African and African American artists.

			By the artists I was seeing, I decided I wouldn’t do a show of paintings until I helped 100,000 artists. I’ve already been blessed with success in music, and although I was finding freedom in painting, when I saw artists like <a href="jordan_page_2.html">Jordan,</a> <a href="hank_page_2.html">Hank,</a> <a href="derrick_page_2.html"> Brother Derrick,</a> it made me want to be on the other side of the ship, and to help and guide that ship in a different way, and use a different set of skills. That’s why I made the task hard for myself. I set out to help 100,000 artists. I don’t know what that number is now.
