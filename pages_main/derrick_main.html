	Hank, as someone who grew up with a mother who is an artist, what do you make of the art establishment’s growing interest in black art?

			Derrick Thomas: Hank and I remember the older artists—who are getting exposure now—toiling away for most of their lives and not receiving credit or money. For me, I never thought I’d be making money off of what I do. I knew artists who I considered legends did not have money, but they had ideas and community. I considered community to be the prize. It’s good to see the results from the hard work of senior-level artists. The younger artists don’t have as much of that baggage. But the presence of<a href="black_art.html">black artists</a>in museums and galleries is still not equal.
