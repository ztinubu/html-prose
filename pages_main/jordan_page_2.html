			JC: I tell my students that I’ve had access to a <a href="hank_page_2.html">community</a> at Yale [as an undergraduate], which opened up a world to me. Through access comes responsibility, but also awareness of a world that you might not have been aware of before education. It’s my responsibility to tell my students at Rutgers to not only be great painters but also how to write an email, a résumé, how to be professional, to move through the world with confidence as their best selves. Also, through my paintings, I have the opportunity to choose who I want to represent on the walls of museums. I didn’t see the value of my image, or someone who looked like me, in a museum when I was growing up, but now I can change that by <a href="conclusion.html">welcoming people</a> who I’ve come to know and love as subjects in my work.
