	Hank, as someone who grew up with a mother who is an artist, what do you make of the art establishment’s growing interest in black art?

			Hank Willis Thomas: All of us are responsible. The first thing I always like to point out is, as great as it is to be embraced and accepted in the mainstream art world, you always run the risk of being co-opted. Also, I fundamentally believe modernism as an art form started in Africa.

		<p> So, I think what we call mainstream Western art is an offshoot of African art.</p>

				 <a href=jordan_main.html>I remember having a conversation with Jordan six or seven years ago.</a>  We were talking about the generational shift [for African and African American artists]. I was in the generation with <a href=derrick_main.html>Derrick,</a>  who benefited from Carrie Mae Weems and <a href="black_art.html">Lorna Simpson,</a> but then Jordan’s <a href="conclusion.html">generation</a> has taken the ball and run so much further. Each person, each generation has something to contribute.
