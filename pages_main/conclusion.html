			SB: A lot of people know me more for painting than collecting. I got so inspired by the artists I was seeing, I decided I wouldn’t do a show of paintings until I helped 100,000 artists. I’ve already been blessed with success in <a href="swizz_page_2.html">music,</a> and although I was finding freedom in painting, when I saw artists like Jordan, Hank, Brother Derrick, it made me want to be on the other side of the ship, and to help and guide that ship in a different way, and use a different set of skills. That’s why I made the task hard for myself. I set out to help 100,000 artists. I don’t know what that number is now.

			HTW: At least that!

			SB: But we have to set those kinds of goals to <a href="../index.html">help each other.</a>Painting for me is therapy, but I knew my mission was to help the artists as much as possible. I should make my goal 200,000 now.
