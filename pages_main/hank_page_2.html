	How do we negotiate the <span class="highlight">privilege</span> of <span class="highlight">education</span> and still extend opportunities to artists who don’t have the support of a community during instrumental stages of their careers?

			HTW: There is a certain amount of privilege that brought us all here, of course, but I do think we need to reframe value and privilege from an Afrocentric perspective because the Western definition of privilege, and what it offers us, is incomplete. It doesn’t accommodate for our <a href="../index.html">black peers</a> who were smarter and more talented than we were but, due to the system we have to operate in, didn’t make it as far as we have. There has been value extracted from Africa for centuries, and we don’t always know when we’re sitting on potential—we often feel as though we have to wait for the outside world to <a href="black_art.html">validate us.</a> Those of us who don’t have education likely have a unique way of seeing the world, and that is valuable in itself.
